/**
 * Calculates a string, which is between two strings, if strings are sorted in alphabetic order.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *  - 'a', 'z' => 's'
 *  - 'a', 'b' => 'as'
 *  - 'as, 'b' => 'au'
 *  - 'aa, 'ab' => 'aas' // there's no precision limit
 *  - null, 'c' => 'b' // insert first
 *  - 'c', null => 'u' // insert last
 *
 * This approach allows to add order to arbitrary list of items.
 *
 * Any item can be moved to any place in the list by modifying only one attribute. So:
 * - you can save only moved item(s) to server, not the whole list
 * - you can store items in any suitable structure, e.g. - Map<id, Item>, instead of plain arrays
 * - server can trivially update items, as usual fields
 * - server can sort items as well - we use only ASCII 0-9 and a-z, to there's no collation issues
 * - it's better than using integer numbers: no need to renumber items in case you need to insert an item between 1 and 2
 * - it's better than using floats: they can have limited precision, which can lead to complicated issues
 *
 * The function implements a basic average of 2 numbers: (a + b)/2, interpreting strings as fractional part of base-36 number.

 * @param inputA order string before (can be start for the start of the list)
 * @param inputB order string after (can be null for the end of the list)
 * @returns order string between inputA and inputB
