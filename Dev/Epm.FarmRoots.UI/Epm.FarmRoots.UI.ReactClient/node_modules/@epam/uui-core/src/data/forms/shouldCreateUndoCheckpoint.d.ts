/**
 * Determines if useForm should create a new undo checkpoint.
 * c is the new change, a and b are previous checkpoints.
 * Returns false only if:
 * - a and b has exactly the same structure (types of fields recursively)
 * - scalar fields changed between b and c, are the same as between a and b.
 * In other words, it returns true only if user just edited the very same scalar field, as he did the last time
